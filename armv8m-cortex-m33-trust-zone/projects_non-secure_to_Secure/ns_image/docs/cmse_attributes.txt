When using the -mcmse flag in GCC for Arm Cortex-M33, several C code attributes can be associated with the Constrained Memory Storage for Exceptions (CMSE) support. These attributes help specify the behavior of code concerning secure and non-secure areas, ensuring that exception handling adheres to the security model of TrustZone.

Here are some commonly used attributes related to CMSE:


-----------------------------------------------
__attribute__((cmse_nonsecure_entry)):

This attribute is applied to a function and indicates that it can be called from non-secure code. It marks the function as a non-secure entry point, allowing secure functions to be called from non-secure applications safely.
void secure_function(void) __attribute__((cmse_nonsecure_entry));

-------------------------------
__attribute__((cmse_secure)):

This attribute indicates that a function or variable is placed in the secure memory region. It restricts access to that function or variable from the non-secure world.
void secure_function(void) __attribute__((cmse_secure));

--------------------------
__attribute__((cmse_nonsecure)):

This attribute marks functions or variables that are specifically designed for the non-secure world, ensuring they are not accessible from secure code.
void nonsecure_function(void) __attribute__((cmse_nonsecure));

----------------------------------
__attribute__((section("secure"))):

This attribute can be used to place a function or variable in a specific memory section that is designated as secure. This section typically corresponds to secure memory regions defined in the linker script.
void secure_function(void) __attribute__((section("secure")));




-------------------------------------
Access Control:
In addition to attributes, you might also define access control for structs, unions, or data elements that should be accessible differently depending on the context (secure or non-secure).
When using these attributes, make sure your development environment and toolchain (like the linker script) support the necessary configurations to segregate secure and non-secure resources properly. Always refer to the ARM documentation and the GCC manual for specifics about these attributes and their usage in CMSE-enabled projects.
